          <h5 class="card-title">Girl Scout Cookies</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Girl Scout Cookies is an indica-dominant hybrid with a strong sativa component (40:60 sativa/indica ratio). This strain can reach THC levels of up to 28%, meaning it's one of the most potent strains available to medical marijuana patients. This strain provides the best aspects of both sativa and indica, and the high is powerful, happy, and euphoric, but with couch-lock body effects and feelings of lethargy. Girl Scout Cookies tastes sweet and earthy, and it smells much the same. It's most effective at treating anxiety, stress, and depression, though it's also good for appetite. Dry mouth is the only likely adverse effect, though others are possible. This strain began as a crossbreed of OG Kush and a near-even hybrid; (Durban Poison X F1). Girl Scout Cookies first appeared in California and is now one of the most popular strains in North America, where sells best on the West Coast and in Michigan. The high lasts for hours, making Girl Scout Cookies a good deal in most places. It can be difficult to grow, but it's fast becoming a staple among home cultivators.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Skywalker</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Skywalker is a popular strain across the United States, a hybrid with an even 50:50 sativa/indica ratio. Its THC levels top off at about 15 percent, making this an average to below-average strain in terms of potency. But it makes up for that with its mellow body high and mental clarity, plus a pleasing aroma and flavor. It's a cross of Blueberry and Mazar-I-Sharif, both famous strains in their own right. The high is mostly relaxed, with euphoria and a mood boost. This is a good strain for insomnia, as well as anxiety, ADHD, bipolar disorder, migraines, and PMS. It's particularly effective at pain relief. Dry mouth and red eyes are likely, while other adverse are much more limited. The taste of this strain is pungent and sweet, with earthy tones. Skywalker is most commonly found on the West Coast, in Arizona, and in Colorado. But it's relatively easy to find on any legal market, as well as the black market in many parts of the country. The indica stress relief of this versatile strain make it a good choice for patients looking for a break.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Chemdawg</h5>
          <p class="card-text">With a near-even balance between sativa and indica (sativa/indica ratio of 45/55), Chemdawg, also known as Chemdog, delivers on both fronts. A clear cerebral high drives creativity while a stony, sleepy body high fights insomnia and relaxes the muscles. This strain has THC levels up to 19%, meaning it's more potent than most. It has a powerful spicy, plant-like taste and smell with a hint of diesel; the aroma alone can alert snoopy neighbors to even a carefully concealed pot grow. Not surprisingly, Chemdawg is used to produce Sour Diesel, one of the world's most popular strains. Little is known about Chemdawg's history or genetics, though there are urban legends involving a Grateful Dead concert, a handful of seeds, and a grower named Chemdog. Best for anxiety and pain, this strain is also helpful with depression and ADHD, as well as migraines, arthritis, and PMS. Dry mouth and dry eyes are possible when using this strain, while other side effects are less likely. Chemdawg is most popular on the West Coast, in Nevada, and in Colorado. It's possible to find on the black market but doesn't come around very often.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Northern Lights</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Few strains come with as much widespread renown as Northern Lights, inarguably one of the most popular strains of all time. An inbred descendant of original Afghani landrace strains, Northern Lights is a pure indica. THC levels can reach 16-21%, making this one of the most potent strains available on any market. A couple hits is all it takes for most patient's seeking this strain's powerful body effects, an upbeat mix of euphoria and physical relaxation. CBD levels are less clear, but they certainly aren't high enough to recommend this as a treatment for seizures or other conditions that respond to CBD. Even so, Northern Lights is a highly useful medical strain, effective at treating anxiety, pain, and insomnia, as well as lack of appetite. Cottonmouth is common, as are red eyes, while other negative effects are much more limited. This strain has a sweet, earthy flavor with hints of citrus. Northern Lights is most popular on the West Coast and in Colorado, but it's a favorite pretty much everywhere else marijuana can be found.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Green Crack</h5>
        <p class="card-text">A perennial favorite, Green Crack is a sativa-dominant hybrid that was bred by inbreeding Skunk #1. Green Crack is usually sativa-dominant, but there's also a less popular indica-heavy version of the strain. Green Crack got its name from Snoop Dogg, though it's also known as Green Cush or simply Cush among smokers who prefer not to reference cocaine. This highly addictive strain is massively potent, with top THC levels reaching 24%. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35. The high is decidedly cerebral, with a big mood boost and a jolt of energy. This strain spurs creativity and helps patients get things done. It's most effective in treating anxiety and depression, along with ADHD, PTSD, and migraines. Green Crack has a sweet flavor with tropical and citrus notes. The buds are dense and tight. Dry mouth occurs frequently, while dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia, happen less often. It's most common in the Pacific Northwester, California, Arizona, and Colorado. But it can be found almost anywhere else with relative ease. It's one of the most popular strains on the black market for this reason.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Shipwreck</h5>
    <p class="card-text">An intense strain that is a result of crossing Trainwreck and Mothership, Shipwreck can exceed your expectations. The cannabis strain is mostly sativa with a 60/40 sativa/indica ratio and 12  15 % THC content. The Shipwreck plant can be grown indoors but it will truly thrive outdoors. An excellent choice for novice gardeners, the plant is harvested in October and has a moderate yield with a flowering time of 9 10 weeks. The plant produces several super resinous and thick buds that are tinted with shades of bright green and neon purple. The strain can help fight depression, anxiety, fatigue, migraine, inflammation, insomnia and eating disorders. The pungent skunky and diesel like aroma of this strain teamed up with the mouth-watering flavors of spice, citrus and dank with hints of lingering sweetness offer a good toke to those who want to relieve stress. The strain is quick to settle in and offers a buzz that stays for hours on end. A few tokes will give you a euphoric high and get you stoned to the core, after which you will no longer feel any pain.</p>
