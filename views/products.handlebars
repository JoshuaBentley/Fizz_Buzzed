        <p class="card-text">A perennial favorite, Green Crack is a sativa-dominant hybrid that was bred by inbreeding Skunk #1. Green Crack is usually sativa-dominant, but there's also a less popular indica-heavy version of the strain. Green Crack got its name from Snoop Dogg, though it's also known as Green Cush or simply Cush among smokers who prefer not to reference cocaine. This highly addictive strain is massively potent, with top THC levels reaching 24%. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35. The high is decidedly cerebral, with a big mood boost and a jolt of energy. This strain spurs creativity and helps patients get things done. It's most effective in treating anxiety and depression, along with ADHD, PTSD, and migraines. Green Crack has a sweet flavor with tropical and citrus notes. The buds are dense and tight. Dry mouth occurs frequently, while dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia, happen less often. It's most common in the Pacific Northwester, California, Arizona, and Colorado. But it can be found almost anywhere else with relative ease. It's one of the most popular strains on the black market for this reason.</p>

        <p class="card-text">With a near-even balance between sativa and indica (sativa/indica ratio of 45/55), Chemdawg, also known as Chemdog, delivers on both fronts. A clear cerebral high drives creativity while a stony, sleepy body high fights insomnia and relaxes the muscles. This strain has THC levels up to 19%, meaning it's more potent than most. It has a powerful spicy, plant-like taste and smell with a hint of diesel; the aroma alone can alert snoopy neighbors to even a carefully concealed pot grow. Not surprisingly, Chemdawg is used to produce Sour Diesel, one of the world's most popular strains. Little is known about Chemdawg's history or genetics, though there are urban legends involving a Grateful Dead concert, a handful of seeds, and a grower named Chemdog. Best for anxiety and pain, this strain is also helpful with depression and ADHD, as well as migraines, arthritis, and PMS. Dry mouth and dry eyes are possible when using this strain, while other side effects are less likely. Chemdawg is most popular on the West Coast, in Nevada, and in Colorado. It's possible to find on the black market but doesn't come around very often.</p>
